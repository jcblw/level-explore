# Level Explore

This is a app/cli tool to check out data inside of leveldb directory. It uses [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
[Blessed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blessed) and [Levelup/Leveldown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/levelup)

> This is very early stages

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/jcblw/level-explore.git

Once in the root of the repo run

    npm link
    level-explore ../../sorry-this/can-only/be-ran/from-this/directory/.db

Right now this is the only way it works due to a know issue. Hopefully will be fixed with updates to tooling :D
